This is possible because this solution can be modeled by checking whether these emails are structured as a Yes/No question or not. \n","\n","For example, 'Can I share your email?', 'Am i allowed to share your email', 'I can share your email, can't I?' are all Yes/No questions. In the english language, there are several principles that must be met before a Yes/No question can be formed. They are:\n","\n","-  The auxillary verb comes immediately before pronoun/subject at the beginning or end of the sentence. In a statement, it is the other way round. For example, in the sentence 'Can I share your email?'. The auxillary verb 'can' comes immediately before the subject/pronoun 'I'. This is the same in the sentence - 'I can share your email, can't I?'.\n","This is by far the strongest determinant of a successful Yes/No question formation and consequently has the greatest weight in my solution.\n","\n","- The use of punctuation marks '?' at the end of the sentence which confers a question.\n","\n","- Specific to this problem is the use of the past tense of share -'shared'. The word 'shared' in a student's email would indicate that the email address has already been shared in the past before the student even sent the index mail.\n","\n","\n","\n","## Implementation of Solution\n","Therefore, I use these 3 points above to craft a solution to the problem.\n","\n","To solve this effectively, I will need a part of speech [POS] tagger. I will use the inbuilt POS tagger in the spacy library to retrieve the part of speech of every given word in an email text.\n","\n","All codes are well commented below. 5 functions have been created:\n","\n","- `batch_classify()`: This is the main function. It takes input as a string of email text or list of email text. It calls all other functions. It processes accordingly and produces either a 'Student wants to know if your email can be shared' or 'Student has shared your email'.\n","\n","- `batch_preprocess()`: This function takes an email (given that it contains the stem ' share' and the word 'email', tokenizes it using spacy library. Then it gets the POS tags associated with it. Using this tags, we can check the email text to see if the auxillary verb comes immediately before the subject/pronoun or not. It also checks if the word 'share' is in its base form or past participle ('shared') form in the email sentence using the tags (known as tense_score) and if there is a '?' in the email text (punctuation score). It is facilitated using multiprocessing.\n","\n","- `batch_get_scores()`: This function checks if the auxillary verb comes immediately before the pronoun/subject at the beginning or end of the sentence. it assigns a score of 1 if it does and 0 if it does not (verb_before_pronoun score).\n","\n","- `batch_calc_total_score()`: It evaluates all the criteria (3 points above) and calculates a custom total score using a predefined formula (weighted average). \n","\n","- `pad_sequences()`: This function is used to pad each email text to the same length so multiple emails can be processed in batches.\n","\n","#### WorkFlow\n","`batch_classify` after a call passes its arguments to `batch_preprocess` which first checks if the emails contain the stem 'share' and the word 'email. Here, it will also be tokenized and all POS information collected and stored in a tuple that includes the tokenized word itself. \n","\n","Also, the tense form of the verb 'share' is collected and stored as 1 if in past participle format or 0 if in base or present form **(tense_score)**. It also check if it contains a '?' stored as 1 or 0 if there isnt **(punctuation score)**.\n","\n","This list of tuple is padded to equal length using `pad_sequences` and then passed to `batch_get_scores` that checks if an auxillary verb comes immediately before a pronoun/subject. I take advantage of the multidimensional numpy array to parallelize this condition. Now, if the email meets this condition, it returns a 1 and if not, it returns a 0 **(verb_before_pronoun_score)**.\n","\n","These 3 scores **(tense_score, punctuation score, verb_vefore_pronoun_score)** are then passed to `batch_calc_total_score` that uses a set of customizable predefined weights to calculate a final score. If now predefined weights passed, it calculates a simple average of the 3 scores.\n","\n","\n","If this final score is >= 0.5, `batch_classify` outputs a 'Student wants to know if your email can be shared.' else it returns a 'Student has shared your email' prompt. ** This is done for each email texts if a list is provided**.\n","\n","\n","We eventually test this solution on a list of 30 manually crafted emails (also containing emails that don't contain the stem 'share' and 'email') to visually appreciate the performance of the solution later in the notebook. We also scale this dataset to around 12000 to test the batch processing function.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","## Note\n","The algorithm has been optimized to process emails in batches. This was shown to perform 319 times faster than serial/individual processing. It took the optimized algorithm 1.5 seconds on the average to process 567 email text and about 383 seconds when processing each data point at a time.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"0proUVGa_n6L"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def batch_preprocess(sentences, batch_size=50):\n","  \"\"\"\n","    It takes a list of sentences (or just a sentence) and converts into a list of list of tuples.
